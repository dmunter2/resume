                <H4>A week after graduating college in 2017 was when I began my career in banking. After a few years in I reazlied I was in the wrong career. During this time of searching I stumbled on
                  FreeCodeCamp and I began to dive into their introductory HTML course. I became a little obsessed and took a few of the other courses they had to offer. I was upset because I realized I
had made the mistake of going to college for business when I shouldâ€™ve went the software route. 
                
                    <H8>It wasnt until early 2019 when I discovered an online software engineer program that fit with my schedule and budget. I am currently still enrolled in the course and have dedicated every Sunday-Thursday since April of 2019 to it. I have learned much more then I thought could be possible in this short amount of time.
      With a short amount of time I could see how any
       employer could be worried about what I have acutally have learned, which is why I have attatched some of my
                    favorite projects I have created. Github is where I have been saving all of my projects. You can visit my profile <a href='https://github.com/dmunter2'>here.</a></H8>
